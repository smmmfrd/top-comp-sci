The Odin Project's Computer Science Assignments

A redo of this assignment, as I lost it before making a repository for it.

# Description
Each of the files does it's algorithm, just printing it out to the console on run.

## Linked List - linkedList.js
A fully functional Linked List, when ran the console logs:

```
Starting List:
 (3) -> (1) -> (2) -> null
List Size:
 3
The value at index of 2:
 Node { value: 2, next: null }
Popped Value
 Node { value: 2, next: null }
New List
 (3) -> (1) -> null
This contains the value 1?
 true
Get the Node with the value of 1:
 Node { value: 1, next: null }
List Post Insert Ats:
 (4) -> (6) -> (3) -> (1) -> (5) -> null
List After Removing at Index 0 and 3:
 (6) -> (3) -> (1) -> null
```
